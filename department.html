      <h3>Harness the Power of Liberal Arts</h3>
      <p>At our university, we believe that a strong foundation in liberal arts complements technical education, fostering well-rounded engineers. The integration of humanities, ethics, communication, and critical thinking into the engineering curriculum encourages students to view problems from diverse perspectives. This interdisciplinary approach nurtures creativity, improves problem-solving abilities, and enhances leadership skills. By blending technical expertise with liberal arts, we empower our graduates to think broadly, communicate effectively, and lead with empathy in a rapidly changing world.</p>
